# Novel Outline Generator

Do you want to write a novel? You came to the right place. If it's your first time writing a book, you may want to create an outline. This outline creator is modeled after the "27 chapters" approach first introduced by writer Kat Oâ€™Keefe on her YouTube channel @katytastic.

You can write down your thoughts here and if you get stuck use the generate button to get a little help from a robot. When you are done, click the download button to save your outline. If you want to start over, hit the reset button.

This tool downloads an LLM locally to your browser. There may be slight pauses when generating. None of your info leaves your computer.
